About
-----
The target platform for Kahlua is J2ME (CLDC 1.1), which is commonly included in mobile phones.
Everything in CLDC 1.1 is also included in standard Java so this run in most Java environments.

Goals
-----
The Kahlua project has the following goals (in no particular order):
- Small class file footprint
- Fast runtime of the most common operations
- Same behaviour as standard Lua
- Must be able to run on CLDC 1.1
- Compact and non-redundant source

License
-------
Kahlua is distributed under the MIT licence which is the same as standard Lua which means you can
pretty much use it in any way you want.
However, I would very much appreciate bug reports, bug fixes, optimizations or simply any good idea that might
improve Kahlua
